The first thing i have done to create this task was a pages, loaders inside src
then i have created seperate seperate pages like navbar.jsx and search.jsx and movie.jsx
after that i have just styled the pages and gave the outlook to them
then after that i have done my searched movie should display its content in movie page for that i used state effect navigate hooks
also i haved called my api inside movie page itself rather than creating a loader
i passed my search term from search page to movie page by state handling and got it inside the movie page through encode uri component
now according to search the movie details will be diplayed in the movie page 
then i have used a loader for all the movie according to my genre to displayed in the nav bar page
i also have used pagination method to search for the movies in the next next pages
finally i have 3 pages i displays all the movies that are fetched throgh api and the other two pages one is for the search for a specific movie and the details of the movie will be displayed in the other page
